<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p class="i">IE 5.5, Netscape 6.1, Opera 5.1 or better -- 
<b class="red">the Cataloging Calculator does not work with old versions of Netscape (such as 4.7)
and is not tested with old versions of IE</b>. Users with older and
overloaded machines may experience problems with their browsers freezing
up or not responding to searches.</p>

<p class="i">Note that the Cataloging Calculator takes bit of time to load because it
retrieves a number of large data files when the page is first opened. 
<b class="red">You cannot perform your first search until a message 
appears in the top frame.</b> Once the calculator is loaded, it should 
work well.</p>

<h2>Using the Cataloging Calculator</h2>

<p class="i">The display consists of three frames. The top one displays
search results, the middle one contains the search options, and the bottom
allows fixed field searches. Call number/subject heading correlations and MARC
variable and fixed field information retrieved
from OCLC are displayed in a separate window. There is no need to
close the window because the Cataloging Calculator always uses the same
one.</p>

<h3>To search fixed field elements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Select the type of fixed field you want to search</li>
<li>Click on the appropriate element</li>
<li>The results will be retrieved from OCLC and displayed in a separate 
window. </li>
</ul>

<h3>To search LC or geographic Cutter numbers, geographic area codes, 
country codes, language codes, AACR2 abbreviations, or MARC variable 
fields (bibliographic only)</h3> 

<ul>
<li>Select click on the search type desired</li>
<li>Type an appropriate search such as main entry,
geographic entity, code, MARC tag, or keyword. 
<li>Results for LC Cutter 
numbers start appearing as soon as you make the first keystroke. </li>
<li>All other 
searches will display results interactively starting with the third 
keystroke. </li>
</ul>

<p class="i">If a number of MARC fields are displayed in the results pane 
in response to a keyword query, you may click on any of them to see the 
results in OCLC. If there is only result in response to a query, the 
window will automatically open. <em>Users of slower computers (or 
overtaxed ones) may experience browser freeze ups when performing 
interactive MARC searches</em>. </p>
