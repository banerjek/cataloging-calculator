<h1>The Cataloging Calculator <br />by <a href="http://alptown.com">Kyle Banerjee</a></h1>
<center>Sponsored by <b><a href="http://libtech-consult.com">Library Technology Consultants</a></b></center><p />

The Cataloging Calculator is a cataloging tool that finds variable and
fixed MARC fields (bibliographic and authority data), language codes,
geographic area codes, publication country codes, and AACR2 abbreviations,
LC main entry and geographic Cutter numbers. Both frames and javascript 
must be enabled for this tool to work.

<p /> 

<b>To find a particular MARC tag in the bibliographic and
authority variable length fields</b>, either type the number of the MARC
tag or a keyword that might occur in the tag description. For example, a
search on the word <i>title</i> will retrieve all title fields. This
program retrieves information from OCLC's website, so all MARC data is
created and copyrighted by OCLC. No local fields (e.g. 09X, 69X, etc.) are
listed.

<p />The MARC tag finder is meant to provide quick assistance to
those who are already familiar with MARC tagging. While every effort is
made to ensure accuracy and completeness except as mentioned above, the
information cannot be guaranteed to be correct. However, the author
appreciates any comments you may have.

<p />
To access fixed field elements, just click on the appropriate
element and the results will appear in the results window. Clicking on any
attribute relating to authority records causes the results to appear in
the bottom window rather than the top one.
<b>To look up geographic codes and Cutters, Country Codes, Language Codes
or AACR2 Roman Alphabet and Place Name Abbreviations</b>, just type a few
characters that occur in what you're looking for. This program will
retrieve all results containing your search query. For example, an
abbreviation search for <i>America</i> will retrieve <i>South America</i>
and <i>American Samoa</i>. All geographic Cutters are generated according
to the G 300 Regions and Countries Table in the Shelflisting Manual.
